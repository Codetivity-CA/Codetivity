## How to Run

First, if you don't have git, install it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Now, run `git clone https://github.com/abhathal/Codetivity.git` in your terminal, and then change your directory to `Codetivity/`.

#### Next, make sure you have the dependencies installed:
1. Check if you have NodeJS and npm installed by running `npm --version` in your terminal/command line.
    - If you don't have NodeJS and npm installed, follow [this link](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x) to get it on MacOSX, [this link](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) to get it on Windows, and [this link](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-linux) to get it on Linux.
    - If you already have them, you can update Node by reading [this link](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/update-node-js-latest-version/) and update npm by reading [this link](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
2. Next, be sure to install all dependencies by running `npm install`. By default, this command will install all modules listed as dependencies in `package.json`.
3. If you run into issues, try installing the dependencies individually by running `npm install <module name>`.

#### Then, run the project:
2. Execute 'npm start' command.
2. Open 'localhost:3000' in your browser to view Codetivity

#### Note:
The main view is the code editor view. For now, the landing page can be accessed by clicking the 'Codetivity' logo on the top left. Later, the landing page will be the main page, and the user will have to login or sign up to view the code editor view.
