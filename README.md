## How to Run

#### If you don't have git, install it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
Now, open your terminal and in a directory of your choice run `git clone https://github.com/abhathal/Codetivity.git`, then change your directory to `Codetivity/`.

#### Next, make sure you have the dependencies installed:
1. Check if you have NodeJS and npm installed by running `npm --version` in your terminal/command line.
    - If you don't have NodeJS and npm installed, follow [this link](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x) to get it on MacOSX, [this link](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) to get it on Windows, and [this link](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-linux) to get it on Linux.
    - If you already have them, you can update NodeJS by reading [this link](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/update-node-js-latest-version/) and update npm by reading [this link](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
2. Next, be sure to install all dependencies by running `npm install`. By default, this command will install all modules listed as dependencies in `package.json`.
3. If you run into issues, try installing the dependencies individually by running `npm install <module name>`.

#### Then, run the project:
1. Ensure you're in `Codetivity/` and execute `npm start` command.
2. Open 'localhost:3000' in your browser to view Codetivity

## MVC file structure (loosely adherent)

- **Model** `/routes/` – Back-end connecting with Firebase
- **View** `/views/` – Rendered expressJS view (what the client-side sees)
- **Controller** `/public/javascripts` – Angular javascript code that controls the view, and uses the Model for data operations
